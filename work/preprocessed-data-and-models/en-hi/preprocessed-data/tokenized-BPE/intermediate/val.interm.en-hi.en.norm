It is clear that the DTO office itself accepts that DLs are being delivered after one month, while the service act specifies that the deadline is seven days.

There are very many applicants to whom the DL has not been delivered even after 1 month.
The number of applicants who are being moved around the office for two to three months are countless.

This fact was revealed after the investigation by the Environment Protection Board.
The investigation that was conducted last year at different places, during Diwali, showed that the noise pollution reached a level of 100 decibels.
On an ordinary day it is usually 55 decibels.
Every year the noise pollution level increases due to the noise of the firecrackers or loud DJ music.
Even after the restrictions imposed by the government people are continuing to sell and buy high decibel crackers openly.
The management and prevention of the above activities is the responsibility of the local S.D.M, but they avoid this responsibility even when needed.
The Environment Protection Board had measured the noise pollution near the traffic police station last year during Diwali.
The investigation was done before Diwali on the 10th of November at different times.
The minimum noise level was found to be 72.5 decibels and the maximum 83.6 decibels.
Similarly, during Diwali, on the 13th of November 2013, the maximum sound level was 87.7 decibels and the minimum was 80 decibels.
During Diwali a maximum of 100.3 decibels of noise pollution was recorded and the minimum was 72.1 decibels.
On an ordinary day the maximum level of noise pollution recorded was 65 decibels, while the minimum was found to be 55 decibels.
Unfortunately, people don't care about the level of increased noise pollution and continue to buy high decibel firecrackers.
