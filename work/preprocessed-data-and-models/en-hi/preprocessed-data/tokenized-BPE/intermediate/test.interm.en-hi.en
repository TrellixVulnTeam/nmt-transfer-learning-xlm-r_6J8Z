Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake
A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.
The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.
How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new "mini-jumbo" jet designs.
Boeing says its revamped "777X" will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast.
Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.
Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.
It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled "Would You Accept This?"
"Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data.
The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.
Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.
It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.
"It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful," said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.
Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design.
The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.
"The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
"Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.
While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.
Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.

While addressing a rally Modi said, "If you listen to all the speeches given by all the leaders of Congress, then you will see that they never talk about what they have done."
He said, "Congress has become so arrogant that does not answer media questions."
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and it is his government, yet they want Modi to respond.
Answering the public's questions is your duty.
Clearly, Modi was referring to Sibal, who had told journalists in Delhi that Modi wants to create an environment where he is in control, where he gives his speeches and he does not talk to journalists in order to avoid their questions.
Sibal challenged Modi to a face to face debate.
Modi said, "I promise the people of the country that when the BJP will form the government in 2014, then we will submit a report each year to the public."

Built in 1913, this British-era building was the Municipal Corporation's first office.
In 1995 the building was handed over to the Power Board.
The department just did some painting by way of repairs.
The building has deteriorated to the extent that employees are afraid of working in it.
The building's condition is so poor that often plaster falls from the ceiling.
In the past month, plaster has fallen from the ceiling in four rooms.
Because of this a female employee was injured.
The JE and Revenue accountant narrowly escaped injury in this accident.
Currently nearly four hundred employees work in the building.
These include the SE along with 5 Ex.Ens., 12 SDOs, 20 Junior Engineers, 130 Clerical staff, 200 Technical Workers and 20 other staff members.
Even though the situation is so bad, the PowerCom top officials have taken no steps to secure their safety so far.
Three rooms allotted to the JEs, for scooter and cycle parking, and two rooms on the upper floor of the building have complete collapsed.

The students studying various courses, including technical and administrative courses, will be able to exercise their right to vote.
The University Vice-Chancellor wrote to the governor seeking permission to hold elections.
The University Students' Union had demanded to begin the election process.
They also organised a petition to support the campaign and make their voices heard by the university administration and college management.
The students enrolling in over two dozen courses including B.Tech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science held on the campus, will be able to elect their representative.
More than six thousand students will be getting their first opportunity to exercise their franchise.
The Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Ashok Kumar, said that the university has sought permission from the Governor for the election.
Once approval is obtained the election date will be announced.
He said it is the responsibility of the college administration to hold elections in other colleges.
Many colleges do not want to hold Student Union elections in their campus.
However, due to the lack of unity among the students, elections were not being held.
The Union organised a petition for elections.

During the revelation on Italian Radio 2, when Polanco was asked what would happen if those two were to get married, Polanco replied that they are already married.
This was not a public ceremony.
This wedding was held in the chapel at the former Prime Minister's home.
