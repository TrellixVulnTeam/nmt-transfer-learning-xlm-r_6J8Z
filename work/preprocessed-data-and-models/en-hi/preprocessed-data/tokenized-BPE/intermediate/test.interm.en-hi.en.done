jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake
a row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights , setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month &apos;s dubai airshow .
the dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines , but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by airbus sas and boeing co .
airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches ( 46 cm ) wide in economy cabins , but its u.s. arch-rival boeing says it should be for airlines to decide .
the dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft , with potentially record orders expected at the november 17-21 event .
how the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot; mini-jumbo &quot; jet designs .
boeing says its revamped &quot; 777x &quot; will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row .
airbus says the competing version of its a350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast .
plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press .
now , airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the dubai airshow , where the 777x is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders .
it recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant , titled &quot; would you accept this ? &quot;
&quot; boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props , &quot; said airbus sales chief john leahy .
as diets change , people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed .
between the early 1970s , when the boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average american 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent , according to u.s. health department data .
the waist of the average 21st-century american male is 39.7 inches , according to u.s. health statistics .
airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average girth of the newly christened &quot; jet set &quot; was narrower .
airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent .
boeing disputes airbus &apos;s figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities .
it also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat .
&quot; it really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful , &quot; said boeing cabins expert kent craver .
they don &apos;t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for flyers it is about more elbow room , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings .
behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $ 700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades , enough to tip the scales of u.s. and european exports .
as reuters first reported in july , seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets .
both airbus and boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment , the 365-seat boeing 777-300er .
boeing &apos;s performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777x with an original 9-abreast 777 design .
the gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use .
&quot; the reason boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products , &quot; said kevin keniston , head of passenger comfort at europe &apos;s airbus .
on the other hand , analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout , which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares .
&quot; eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from a business point of the airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777 , &quot; said cabin interiors expert mary kirby , founder and editor of the runway girl network .
airbus and boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from .
globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts .
while boasting comfort , all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel .
airbus offers a 10-abreast a350 but says it has not yet sold it .
until recently , airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets .
without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets , experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly , but could distract from a wave of 777x sales .

while addressing a rally modi said , &quot; if you listen to all the speeches given by all the leaders of congress , then you will see that they never talk about what they have done . &quot;
he said , &quot; congress has become so arrogant that does not answer media questions . &quot;
manmohan singh is the prime minister and it is his government , yet they want modi to respond .
answering the public &apos;s questions is your duty .
clearly , modi was referring to sibal , who had told journalists in delhi that modi wants to create an environment where he is in control , where he gives his speeches and he does not talk to journalists in order to avoid their questions .
sibal challenged modi to a face to face debate .
modi said , &quot; i promise the people of the country that when the bjp will form the government in 2014 , then we will submit a report each year to the public . &quot;
